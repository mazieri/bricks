## Command

`mason make mod --on-conflict append`

- this command will see that it has conflicts (the rest of the code) and will add "lastly" in 2 files: `app_module.dart` and `modules_exports.dart`
- Remember to fix the position of the module in the file `app_module.dart`

## Bricks

- +1 module
- modules export
- app module (manually fix where it is placed in lib/src/app_module)
